This is my back-dated mail processing application.

version 1
---------
The original code is under the package org.ethelred.mymailtool. I used this for quite a while, but it was not as flexible
as I would like, so I wrote the version 2 tool.

version 2
---------
This rewrite is intended to be flexible in terms of how messages are processed. It is designed to support different
languages for specifying the configuration. Currently the only finished one is 'PropertiesFileConfiguration', which is
roughly compatible with my old code.

I have a 'work in progress' Javascript configuration which relies on the Javascript interpreter built in to recent versions
of the JDK. The idea is that this will allow additional logic to be specified as JS functions.
